GENERAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS

 
1) 	VENDOR OBLIGATIONS.

(a) Vendor Performance of Work. Vendor agrees to provide services described in a Statement of Work (such services hereinafter referred to as “Work”) under the terms and conditions of, and in conformance with, this Agreement and any applicable Statements of Work (“SOW”). The precise scope of the Work, including specifications and time requirements, will be specified in applicable SOW(s). Microsoft and Vendor, or any of their respective Affiliates, can enter into SOWs, provided that Vendor’s Affiliates may not enter into a SOW without Microsoft’s prior authorization. An “Affiliate” is any legal entity that owns, is owned by, or is under common ownership with Vendor or Microsoft. Ownership means more than 50% ownership. Vendor is not obligated to provide any Work and Microsoft is not obligated to pay for any Work until a SOW has been fully executed by both parties. This Agreement does not obligate either party or its Affiliates to enter into any SOW(s).

(b) Revisions to Work. Microsoft reserves the right, from time to time during the term of this Agreement, to expand, supplement, modify or reduce the scope of the Work under any SOW (a “Change”) upon written notice to Vendor and execution by both parties of documentation specifying such Change. In the event Microsoft requests a Change, the Parties will use reasonable efforts to agree in writing on necessary adjustments (if any) to the other terms of the applicable SOW necessary to accommodate the requested Change. Vendor agrees that it will cooperate in good faith with Microsoft in performing the Work as reasonably required by Microsoft, including any Changes requested by Microsoft. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Vendor shall not be obligated to work on a Change that results in a net expansion of the Work until the Parties have agreed in writing on such Change.

(c) Reports. Vendor shall comply with all applicable time requirements in providing Microsoft with the reports specified in an applicable SOW (each a “Report”), and all other information, as mutually agreed by both parties, as requested by Microsoft from time to time with respect to all Work.

(d) Performance Reviews. Upon Microsoft’s request or as specified in an applicable SOW, Vendor will meet with Microsoft to review Vendor’s performance and any issues related to Vendor’s compliance with the performance standards described in an applicable SOW.

(e) Use of Microsoft Facilities and/or Equipment.

(i) Microsoft Equipment. Vendor agrees that it shall not use any Microsoft facilities and/or equipment (including any equipment owned, leased or rented by Vendor for performing its obligations under this Agreement) to perform services for any person or entity other than Microsoft without Microsoft’s prior written consent. In the event Microsoft provides Vendor with equipment for use in performing the Work, Vendor agrees to assume the risk of loss for all such equipment while in its care, custody or control. Vendor shall take all reasonable precautions to protect the equipment against loss, damage, theft or disappearance while in its care, custody or control. In addition, Vendor shall take no actions which affect Microsoft’s title or interest in such equipment.

(ii) Security and Compatibility. Vendor shall comply with all Microsoft physical and information security rules and requirements as may be modified from time to time at Microsoft’s sole discretion. Vendor shall ensure that its systems remain compatible with Microsoft’s systems as necessary to perform its obligations under this Agreement at Vendor’s sole expense.

2) 	FEES AND PAYMENT TERMS.

(a) Rates. Microsoft agrees to pay Vendor for the Work in accordance with the fee schedule as specifically stated in applicable SOW(s) (“Fees”). ****

(b) Payment Terms. Upon receipt of a correct and undisputed invoice, Microsoft shall, at its option, pay the invoice net **** on the invoiced amount or net ****. Invoices submitted more than **** after completion of the related work shall be paid at Microsoft’s sole discretion.

(c) MS Invoice. Vendor shall invoice Microsoft for all amounts due under this Agreement via the MS Invoice online tool, or other agreed upon tool or process, in accordance with the then-current requirements set forth at http://invoice.microsoft.com. Invoices shall not bear an invoice date earlier than the date on which Vendor shall be entitled to be paid under the applicable SOW, or if not specified in the applicable SOW, ****.

(d) Payment Method. Payments by Microsoft shall be made according to Microsoft’s then-current payment policies, which may include payment via ACH electronic payment to Vendor’s financial institution pursuant to instructions supplied to Microsoft by Vendor in Microsoft’s ACH Electronic Payment form.

(e) Disputed Amounts. Microsoft may dispute any payable amount by notice to Vendor in writing within **** days of the date on Vendor’s invoice, specifying the reason for the dispute and the charges disputed (“Disputed Amounts”). Payment of an invoice without asserting a dispute is not a waiver of any claim or right. Failure by Microsoft to dispute any invoiced amount within the periods set forth above shall not be deemed a waiver of any claims that were unknown to Microsoft at the time.

 
3) 	SUBCONTRACTING OF WORK.

Vendor may subcontract all or any portion of the Work to a third party (“Subcontractor”) upon notice to Microsoft, except that Microsoft hereby consents to subcontracting with any entity that is a participant in good standing in the MSVP. With respect to use of a Subcontractor, Vendor shall comply with Exhibit D and the following conditions:

(a) Vendor guarantees Subcontractor’s fulfillment of applicable Vendor obligations.

(b) Vendor indemnifies Microsoft for all damages and costs of any kind, to the extent set forth in Section 7 (General Indemnification), incurred by Microsoft **** and caused by Subcontractor’s acts or omissions.

The existence of and terms and conditions of this Agreement and any Microsoft Information shall be considered Confidential Information under the NDA. Microsoft Information shall mean all information provided by Microsoft to Vendor in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and any information obtained or created by Vendor in providing the Work, including, without limitation any information found in any Report provided by Vendor to Microsoft, any correspondence between Microsoft and Vendor, including without limitation e-mail transmissions, and any Microsoft customer lists, and updates, identification information (including, without limitation, all customer information and personal information of any variety acquired by Vendor pursuant to this Agreement or in connection with the performance of the Work and regardless of the source; transactional, sales and activity information; and customer profile information (all of the foregoing collectively “Customer Information”)). However, Microsoft will have the right to compile and use statistical analyses and reports utilizing aggregated data derived from Vendor information and data and other sources, for Microsoft’s internal business purposes.

Personal Information. Such notice will comply with all relevant guidelines contained at http://members.microsoft.com/vendorguide or as otherwise provided by Microsoft.

Vendor shall use such Personal Information only as necessary to perform the Work in accordance with this Agreement and not for any other purpose whatsoever.

Vendor will not share any Personal Information that is collected or possessed by Vendor with any third parties for any reason except as necessary to carry out the Work, and only under terms and conditions of Section 3 (Subcontracting of Work).

Security measures shall include access controls, encryption or other means, where appropriate. Vendor must immediately notify Microsoft of any known security breach that may result in the unauthorized use, access, disclosure, alteration or destruction of Personal Information. Vendor agrees to conduct an audit on at least an annual basis to evaluate the security of Personal Information in Vendor’s possession and to verify that the terms of this Agreement with respect to Personal Information are being followed. The results of such audit shall be made available to Microsoft upon request.

Upon request from Microsoft, Vendor shall provide Microsoft with any or all Personal Information in Vendor’s possession. Upon termination or expiration of this Agreement, Vendor shall within ten (10) calendar days thereafter, at Microsoft’s sole discretion either (i) provide Microsoft with all documents and materials (including any and all copies) containing Personal Information, together with all other materials and property of Microsoft, which are in its possession or under its control or (ii) destroy all such specified documents and materials (including any and all copies in any and all formats) and provide Microsoft with a certificate of destruction signed by an officer of Vendor.

(c) Credit Card Information Compliance. Vendor, its affiliates and their respective subcontractors, as applicable, shall at all times comply, at its own cost, with the PCI Data Security Standards (PCI DSS) requirements for any work involving cardholder data as prescribed by the PCI Security Standards Council as the same may be amended from time to time.

Vendor hereby grants Microsoft a non-exclusive, perpetual, world-wide, fully paid-up license, under Vendor’s applicable current and future intellectual property and proprietary rights: ****. All other rights in the Pre-Existing Materials are reserved by Vendor.

(d) Databases. If Vendor creates and uses a database as part of the Work (“Database”), Microsoft will own the data entered into that Database. Vendor will own any Pre-Existing Materials subsisting in the Database.

****

(e) Third Party Materials. Vendor shall not use any third party software or other materials to perform Work without Microsoft’s prior express written consent. Vendor shall provide Microsoft with the license terms or other agreements that govern the use of such Materials to the extent available or applicable that Vendor wants to use, and shall abide by them when performing Work.

**** = Certain information has been omitted and filed separately with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Confidential treatment has been requested with respect to the omitted portions.

(a) Vendor agrees to defend, indemnify and hold Microsoft, and its subsidiaries, affiliates, directors, officers, employees and agents (“Indemnified Parties”) harmless from and against all claims, damages, losses, suits, actions, demands, proceedings, expenses, and liabilities of any kind, (including reasonable attorneys’ fees incurred and/or those necessary to successfully establish the right to indemnification) threatened, asserted or filed (collectively, “Claims”) against any Microsoft Indemnified Party, to the extent that in providing the Work such Claims arise out of or relate to (i) bodily injury or death to any person, (ii) loss, disappearance, or damage to property, (iii) any breach or alleged breach of any warranty or representation made by Vendor in this Agreement, (iv) the infringement or violation of any patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret or other proprietary right of a third party and/or (v) any act or omission to act of Vendor, its Subcontractors, or agents, except to the comparative extent that such Claims result from the negligent or willful acts of Microsoft.

(b) If any action is brought against any Microsoft Indemnified Party in which indemnity is sought from Vendor, Microsoft shall (i) provide Vendor reasonably prompt notice of any such Claim; (ii) permit Vendor, through counsel mutually acceptable to Microsoft and Vendor, to answer and defend such Claim; and (iii) provide Vendor information and reasonable assistance at Vendor’s expense to help Vendor to defend such Claim.

(c) Microsoft shall have the right to employ separate counsel and participate in the defense of any Claim at its own expense. Vendor shall reimburse Microsoft for any payments made or losses suffered based upon the judgment of any court of competent jurisdiction or pursuant to a bona fide compromise or settlement of Claims. Vendor shall not settle any Claim on Microsoft’s behalf without first obtaining Microsoft’s written permission.

(d) Should the Work (or any portion thereof) be held to constitute an infringement, Vendor shall notify Microsoft and immediately, at Vendor’s expense: (i) procure for Microsoft the right to continue use, sale, and/or marketing of the Work (or any portion thereof) or (ii) replace or modify the Work (or any portion thereof) such that it is non-infringing, provided that the replacement or modification meets the requirements of this Agreement to Microsoft’s satisfaction. If (i) or (ii) are not possible, in addition to any damages or expenses reimbursed under this Section, Microsoft shall have the right to terminate this Agreement and Vendor shall pay to Microsoft all costs associated with transitioning the Work to a new vendor.

8) LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMMISSIBLE BY LAW, NEITHER PARTY SHALL BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER FOR ANY INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE OR SPECIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, LOSS OF PROFITS, LOSS OF DATA OR LOSS OF USE) INCURRED BY THAT PARTY AS A RESULT OF ANY BREACH OF THIS AGREEMENT. THESE LIMITATIONS SHALL APPLY REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OF ACTION, WHETHER UNDER STATUTE, UNDER EQUITY, OR IN CONTRACT OR TORT, INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE, OR ANY OTHER FORM OF ACTION, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

THIS SECTION SHALL HAVE NO EFFECT UPON, AND SHALL NOT LIMIT LIABILITY FOR ANY CLAIMS, LOSSES OR DAMAGES FOR BREACH OF SECTIONS 4 (CONFIDENTIALITY), 5 (OWNERSHIP & LICENSE), 6 (WARRANTIES & REPRESENTATIONS), 7 (GENERAL INDEMNIFICATION), AND 13 (PUBLICITY & MICROSOFT TRADEMARKS).

10) TAXES. Microsoft is not liable for any taxes that Vendor is legally obligated to pay and which are incurred or arise in connection with the sale of Products and Services. All taxes (including but not limited to net income or gross receipts taxes, franchise taxes, and property taxes) shall be Vendor’s financial responsibility. Microsoft shall pay Vendor any sales or use taxes owed by Microsoft solely as a result of entering into this Agreement or a subsequent SOW and which are required to be collected from Microsoft by Vendor under applicable law. Microsoft may provide Vendor with a valid exemption certificate, and Vendor shall not collect taxes covered by the certificate. Vendor shall indemnify, defend and hold Microsoft harmless from any taxes (including sales or use taxes paid by Microsoft) or claims, causes of action, costs (including without limitation, reasonable attorneys’ fees) and any other liabilities of any nature whatsoever related to taxes. If taxes are required to be withheld on any amount to be paid by Microsoft to Vendor, Microsoft will deduct them from the amount owed and pay them to the appropriate taxing authority. At Vendor’s written request and expense, Microsoft will use reasonable efforts to assist Vendor in obtaining tax certificates or other documentation evidencing such payment, but the responsibility for documentation remains with Vendor. For services delivered outside the United Sates, Microsoft shall specify tax rates for Microsoft products and/or services sold by Vendor acting on Microsoft’s behalf in connection with Vendor providing services in each applicable country outside the United States. Vendor will collect tax on behalf of Microsoft, at Microsoft’s written request, and remit collected tax to Microsoft. Microsoft is responsible for remitting the tax to the appropriate taxing authorities. This Section shall govern the treatment of all taxes arising in connection with this Agreement notwithstanding any other section of this Agreement.

At all times during the Term, Microsoft will be responsible for the provision and maintenance of any telecommunications equipment necessary to reroute customer calls from Microsoft to a mutually agreed demarcation point as defined in the applicable SOW, including all costs associated therewith.

 
2) 	BUSINESS CONTINUITY MANAGEMENT.

Vendor agrees to create, implement and maintain a documented Business Continuity Management (BCM) Framework to provide a comprehensive and structured response capability that caters for planned and unplanned interruption events.

Microsoft expects each site to be governed by the overall Business Continuity Management Framework, as outlined in the annexed Exhibit C

Microsoft reserves the right to suspend this Agreement, at its discretion, until performance of the Work can be resumed.

At all times during the Term of this Agreement, Vendor shall ensure that each Support Professional is capable of responding to customer calls regarding each Microsoft product offering (“Product”) for which the Vendor is currently providing Work. Vendor Support Professionals must take and successfully pass both pre- and post training tests provided to Vendor by Microsoft to measure training effectiveness. Vendor shall be responsible for administering the tests and reporting test results to Microsoft.

(b) Trainers. Vendor will designate trainers for each Product supported to receive Microsoft provided train-the-trainer instruction.

  	• 	  	

We will use and disclose the other’s confidential information only for purposes of our business relationship with each other.

 
  	b. 	Security precautions. Each of us agrees:

 
  	• 	  	

To take reasonable steps to protect the other’s confidential information. These steps must be at least as protective as those we take to protect our own confidential information;

To notify the other promptly upon discovery of any unauthorized use or disclosure of confidential information; and

  	c. 	Sharing confidential information with affiliates and representatives.

 
  	• 	  	

A “representative” is an employee, contractor, advisor or consultant of one of us or one of our respective affiliates.

 
  	• 	  	

Each of us may disclose the other’s confidential information to our representatives (who may then disclose that confidential information to other of our representatives) only if those representatives have a need to know about it for purposes of our business relationship with each other. Before doing so, each of us must:

 
  	• 	  	

ensure that affiliates and representatives are required to protect the confidential information on terms consistent with this agreement; and

 
  	• 	  	

accept responsibility for each representative’s use of confidential information.

Neither of us can control the incoming information the other will disclose to us in the course of working together, or what our representatives will remember, even without notes or other aids. We agree that use of information in representatives’ unaided memories in the development or deployment of our respective products or services does not create liability under this agreement or trade secret law, and we agree to limit what we disclose to the other accordingly.

Each of us may disclose the other’s confidential information if required to comply with a court order or other government demand that has the force of law.

Microsoft aspires to be more than just a good company – it aspires to be a great company. What will make Microsoft great is a strong commitment to our mission of enabling people and businesses throughout the world to realize their full potential. Achieving our mission isn’t just about building innovative technology. It’s also about who we are as a company and as individuals, how we manage our business internally, and how we think about and work with customers, partners, governments, vendors, and communities.

The global business environment is continuously changing and demanding more from us as a company and as employees. Not only does the world expect us to deliver the best products and services, it also expects us to conduct ourselves ethically and responsibly. It is essential that we conduct ourselves at all times with integrity and in full compliance with the laws and regulations that govern our global business activities. Microsoft has established a set of company standards of business practices and regulatory compliance that are set out in the Standards of Business Conduct which applies to all Microsoft employees, directors, and officers (www.microsoft.com/mscorp/legal/buscond). The Microsoft Standards of Business Conduct are an extension of Microsoft’s values and reflect our commitment to ethical business practices and regulatory compliance.

Microsoft expects that its vendors (“Vendors”) will share and embrace the letter and spirit of our commitment to integrity. We understand that Vendors are independent entities; however, the business practices and actions of a vendor may impact and/or reflect upon Microsoft. Because of this, Microsoft expects all Vendors and their employees, agents, and subcontractors (Vendors’ employees, agents, and subcontractors shall hereinafter be referred to collectively as “Representatives”) to adhere to the Microsoft Vendor Code of Conduct while they are conducting business with and/or on behalf of Microsoft. All Microsoft Vendors should educate their Representatives to ensure they understand and comply with the Microsoft Vendor Code of Conduct.

 
a. 	LEGAL AND REGULATORY COMPLIANCE PRACTICES

All Microsoft Vendors and their Representatives shall conduct their business activities in full compliance with the applicable laws and regulations of their respective countries while conducting business with and/or on behalf of Microsoft. In addition to any specific obligations under Vendor’s agreement with Microsoft, all Microsoft Vendors shall, without limitation:

 
  	• 	  	

Comply with all applicable trade controls, export, re-export and import laws or regulations.

 
  	• 	  	

Conduct business in full compliance with antitrust and fair competition laws that govern the jurisdictions in which they conduct business.

 
  	• 	  	

Comply with all applicable environmental laws and regulations regarding hazardous materials, air emissions, waste and wastewater discharges, including the manufacture, transportation, storage, disposal, and release to the environment of such materials.

 
  	•

  	• 	  	

Not participate in international boycotts not sanctioned by the U.S. government or applicable laws.

Comply with the anti-corruption laws of the countries in which it does business, including the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and refrain from making any direct or indirect payments or promises of payments to foreign government officials for the purpose of inducing the individual to misuse his/her position to obtain or retain business.

 
b. 	BUSINESS PRACTICES

Microsoft Vendors and their Representatives shall conduct their business interactions and activities with integrity and in accordance with their obligations under their specific agreements with Microsoft. In addition to any specific obligations under Vendor’s agreement with Microsoft, all Microsoft Vendors shall, without limitation:

 
  	• 	  	

Honestly and accurately record and report all business information and comply with all applicable laws regarding their completion and accuracy.

 
  	• 	  	

Create, retain, and dispose of business records in full compliance with all applicable legal and regulatory requirements.

 
  	• 	  	

Protect and responsibly use both the physical and intellectual assets of Microsoft including property, supplies, consumables, and equipment when authorized by Microsoft to use such assets.

 
  	• 	  	

Use Microsoft provided information technology and systems (including e-mail) only for authorized Microsoft business-related purposes. Microsoft strictly prohibits Vendors and their Representatives from using Microsoft provided technology and systems to create, access, store, print, solicit, or send any material that is intimidating, harassing, threatening, abusive, sexually explicit or otherwise offensive or inappropriate and/or send any false, derogatory, or malicious communications using Microsoft provided information assets and systems.

 
  	• 	  	

Comply with all Microsoft requirements for maintenance of passwords, confidentiality, security, and privacy procedures as a condition of providing Microsoft with goods or services or receiving access to Microsoft’s internal corporate network, all systems and buildings. All data stored or transmitted on Microsoft owned or leased equipment is to be considered private and is the property of Microsoft. Microsoft may monitor all use of the corporate networks and all systems (including e-mail) and/or access all data stored or transmitted using the Microsoft network.

 
  	• 	  	

Comply with the intellectual property ownership rights of Microsoft and others including but not limited to copyrights, patents, trademarks, and trade secrets.

 
  	• 	  	

Use software, hardware and content only in accordance with their associated license or terms of use.

 
  	• 	  	

Speak to the press on Microsoft’s behalf only if Vendor and/or Representative(s) is expressly authorized in writing to do so by Microsoft.

 
  	• 	  	

Use good judgment, discretion, and moderation when offering gifts or entertainment to Microsoft employees. In doing so, the Vendor and/or its Representatives will refrain from giving Microsoft employees an individual gift or a combination of gifts with a value greater than $200.00 in a given year (or any lower amount in accordance with applicable laws) and never offer a bribe, kickback, bartering arrangement for goods or services, and/or any other incentive to a Microsoft employee in order to obtain or retain Microsoft business. Gift giving and entertainment practices may vary in different cultures and waivers to the $200 annual limit above may be possible upon petition to the Microsoft regional controller; however, any gifts and entertainment given or received must be in compliance with the law, must not violate the giver’s and/or receiver’s policies on the matter, and be consistent with local custom and practice.

  	• 	  	

Avoid the appearance of or actual improprieties and/or conflicts of interests. Vendors and/or their Representatives shall not deal directly with any Microsoft employee whose spouse, domestic partner, or other family member or relative holds a significant financial interest in the Vendor. Dealing directly in the course of negotiating the Vendor agreement or performing the Vendor’s obligations with a spouse, domestic partner, or other family member or relative who is employed by Microsoft is also prohibited.

 
  	• 	  	

Avoid insider trading by buying or selling Microsoft’s or another company’s stock when in possession of information about Microsoft or another company that is not available to the investing public and that could influence an investor’s decision to buy or sell stock.

 
  	• 	  	

Prepayments are generally not permitted. In the event that an authorized prepayment has been made by Microsoft for the purchase of specific services or products, the prepayment can only be applied to those services or products expressly set forth in the applicable purchase order or SOW. Any prepayment made on a purchase order that was later cancelled may not be applied to other services or products, and must be returned to Microsoft within **** days of cancellation of the purchase order.

 
c. 	ENVIRONMENTAL PRACTICES

Microsoft expects its Vendors to share in its commitment to environmental conservation through responsible standards and business practices in the workplace. Microsoft Vendors shall conduct their business practices in full compliance with all applicable environmental laws and regulations. Furthermore, Microsoft Vendors should strive, without limitation:

 
  	• 	  	

To implement policies and procedures that reduce wasteful energy and resource consumption.

 
  	• 	  	

To participate in environmentally conscious recycling programs for paper, plastics, computer hardware, and other reusable resources.

 
d. 	EMPLOYMENT PRACTICES

  	• 	  	

Cooperate with Microsoft’s commitment to a workforce free of harassment and unlawful discrimination. While we recognize and respect cultural differences, we believe that Vendor companies should not engage in discrimination in hiring, compensation, access to training, promotion, termination or retirement based on race, color, sex, sexual orientation, national origin, religion, age, disability, gender identity or expression, marital status or veteran status.

 
  	• 	  	

Provide a safe and healthy work environment with adequate people to facilities ratio, noise abatement measures, personal space, work breaks and ventilation.

 
  	• 	  	

Fully comply with all applicable safety and health laws, regulations and practices. Adequate steps shall be taken to minimize the causes of hazards inherent in the working environment.

 
  	• 	  	

Prohibit the use, possession, distribution, and/or sale of illegal drugs while on Microsoft owned or leased property.

 
  	• 	  	

Use only voluntary labor. The use of forced labor whether in the form of indentured labor, bonded labor, or prison labor by a Microsoft Vendor and/or its subcontractors is prohibited.

 
  	• 	  	

Not require workers to lodge or file “deposits”, identity papers or other personal affects with their employer as a condition of continued employment and be free to resign their employment in accordance with local and national laws or regulations without unlawful penalty or retaliation.

 
  	• 	  	

Comply with all local and national minimum working age laws or regulations and not utilize child labor. Furthermore, Vendors shall not employ anyone under the age of 15, under the age for

 

 

Exhibit Page 8

**** = Certain information has been omitted and filed separately with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Confidential treatment has been requested with respect to the omitted portions.

  	

completing compulsory education or under the legal minimum working age for employment, which ever is oldest. Microsoft supports the development of legitimate workplace apprenticeship programs for the educational benefit of younger people and will refrain from doing business with Vendors and/or their Representatives who abuse such systems. Workers under the age of 18 shall not perform hazardous work and may be restricted from night work, with consideration given to educational needs.

 
  	• 	  	

Not engage in physical discipline or abuse. Physical abuse or discipline, the threat of physical abuse, sexual or other harassment, verbal abuse or other forms of intimidation is prohibited.

 
  	• 	  	

Pay living wages under humane conditions. All workers shall be provided with clear, written information about their employment conditions with respect to wages before they enter employment and as needed throughout their term of employment. Any deductions from wages as a disciplinary measure shall not be permitted nor shall any deductions in violation of local or national law be permitted without the express written permission of the worker concerned. All disciplinary measures should be recorded. Wages and benefits paid for a standard working week must meet, at a minimum, national legal standards.

 
  	• 	  	

Not require workers to work more than the maximum hours of daily labor set by local and national laws or regulations; ensure that overtime is voluntary and paid in accordance with local and national laws or regulations.

 
  	• 	  	

Keep employee records in accordance to local and national laws or regulations and provide to the employee, in a timely manner, the basis on which they are being paid via pay stub or similar documentation.

 
  	e. 	COMPLIANCE WITH THE MICROSOFT VENDOR CODE OF CONDUCT

It is the Vendor’s responsibility to ensure its Representatives understand and comply with the Microsoft Vendor Code of Conduct and to inform its Microsoft contact (or a member of Microsoft management) if and when any situation develops that causes the Vendor to operate in violation of the obligations set forth in this document. Microsoft Vendors are expected to self-monitor their compliance with this Vendor Code of Conduct. In addition to any other rights Microsoft may have under its agreement with Vendor, Microsoft may request the immediate removal of any Representative who behaves in a manner that is unlawful or inconsistent with this Code or any Microsoft policy.

 
  	f. 	REPORTING OF QUESTIONABLE BEHAVIOR AND/OR POSSIBLE VIOLATIONS

To report questionable behavior or possible violation of the Vendor Code of Conduct that occurred while a Vendor or its Representative was providing goods or services to Microsoft, Microsoft has a variety of resources available to assist. Please work with your primary Microsoft contact in resolving a business practice or compliance concern, however, Microsoft recognizes there may be times when this is not possible or appropriate to report such matters. In these instances, please contact any of the following:

 
  	1. 	The Microsoft Business Conduct Line at ****.

 
  	2. 	If you are calling from outside the United States, you may make a collect call to the Business Conduct Line by accessing an international operator and asking to place a collect call to ****.

 
  	3. 	If you are a Vendor with access to Microsoft’s intranet, you may send an e-mail to the Director of Compliance by e-mailing the Business Conduct and Compliance alias, ****.

 
  	4. 	

Send a letter to the Director of Compliance at Microsoft Corporation, Law and Corporate Affairs, One Microsoft Way, Redmond, WA 98052 or send a confidential fax to ****.

Article 2: Insurance Requirements

Insurance Requirements. Prior to the commencement of the Services to be performed under this Agreement and throughout the entire Term of this Agreement, Vendor shall procure and maintain the following insurance. Such insurance shall be in a form and with insurers acceptable to Microsoft and shall comply with the following minimum requirements:

(a) Comprehensive General Liability. Vendor will obtain and maintain a policy of “general”, “public”, or “commercial” liability insurance as follows:

(i) Policy limits of not less than $**** each occurrence for bodily injury and $**** each occurrence for damage to property, or, alternatively, $**** combined single limit each occurrence for bodily injury and property damage combined.

(ii) Policy to be the “occurrence” form, including coverage for premises and operations, contractual liability (including insurable contractual liability assumed in this Agreement), broad form property damage, and products and completed operations.

(iii) The policy shall name Microsoft as an additional insured to the extent of the contractual liability assumed by Vendor in this Agreement, and shall contain a severability of interests’ provision in favor of the additional insureds.

(b) Workers’ Compensation – Vendor shall at all times comply with all applicable workers’ compensation, occupational disease, and occupational health and safety laws, statutes, and regulations to the full extent applicable. Such workers’ compensation and occupational disease requirements shall include coverage for all employees of Vendor, and for all employees of any Subcontractor retained by Vendor, suffering bodily injury (including death) by accident or disease, which arises out of or in connection with the performance of this Agreement by Vendor. Satisfaction of these requirements will include, but will not be limited to:

(i) full participation in any required governmental occupational injury and/or disease insurance program, to the extent participation in such program is mandatory in any jurisdiction, and

(ii) purchase of workers’ compensation and occupational disease insurance providing benefits to employees in full compliance with all applicable laws, statutes, and regulations (but only to the extent such coverage is not provided under a mandatory government program as in a.) above), and/or

(iii) maintenance of a legally permitted and governmentally approved program of self insurance for workers’ compensation and occupational disease.

Except to the extent prohibited by law, the program of Vendor’s compliance with workers’ compensation and occupational disease laws, statutes, and regulations in (a), (b), or (c) above will provide for a full waiver of rights of subrogation against Microsoft, its directors, officers, and employees, all of which rights are also hereby waived. If Vendor, or any Subcontractor retained by Vendor, fails to effect and maintain a program of compliance with applicable workers’ compensation and occupational disease laws, statutes, and regulations, and Microsoft incurs liability or fines or is required by law to provide benefits to such employees, or to obtain coverage for such employees, Vendor shall

 

 

Exhibit Page 10

**** = Certain information has been omitted and filed separately with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Confidential treatment has been requested with respect to the omitted portions.

indemnify Microsoft for such fines, payment of benefits to Vendor or Subcontractor employees or their heirs or legal representatives, and/or the cost of effecting coverage on behalf of such employees.

(c) Employers Liability – Vendor shall maintain coverage for employers’ liability with a policy limit of not less than $**** per accident. In jurisdictions where commercial insurance of workers’ compensation is not permitted, this requirement may be fulfilled through addition of an “Employers Stop Gap Liability” endorsement to the comprehensive general liability policy required above.

(d) Professional Liability/Errors & Omissions Liability. Vendor shall maintain policy limits of not less than $**** each claim. Such insurance shall include coverage for infringement of proprietary rights of any third party, including without limitation copyright, trade secret and trademark infringement as related to Vendor’s performance under this Agreement. Throughout the Term of this Agreement, the Professional Liability/Errors & Omissions Liability insurance’s retroactive coverage date will be no later than the Effective Date of this Agreement. Upon expiration or termination of this Agreement, Vendor will either maintain active policy coverage, or an extended reporting period, providing coverage for claims first made and reported to the insurance company within one year after the end of the Agreement.

(e) General Requirements Applicable to All Above Coverages – The following general requirements shall be applicable to all coverages referenced anywhere in this Section:

(i) The above-referenced insurance policies shall be primary and not contributory to any insurance or program of self-insurance maintained by Microsoft.

(ii) Any deductible or retention in excess of $**** per occurrence or accident under any of the above required coverages shall be subject to the approval of Microsoft prior to the commencement of the Agreement.

(iii) All deductibles and premiums associated with the above coverages will be the responsibility of Vendor.

(iv) If in the opinion of Microsoft the amount of liability coverage is not adequate by reason of inflationary pressures, experience or the nature and content of Vendor’s activities, Vendor shall increase the amount of insurance coverage as reasonably required by Microsoft.

(v) At the request of Microsoft, Vendor will provide to Microsoft, or make available for Microsoft’s review, copies of certificates of insurances required herein.

(vi) The above referenced insurance limits shall not in any way limit the liability of Vendor or the liability of any Vendor Subcontractor during their performance under this Agreement. Where any Subcontractor is retained by Vendor in the performance of this Agreement, Vendor shall either require such Subcontractor to assume the same insurance obligations on behalf of Microsoft as are required of Vendor herein, or extend its insurance to cover any Subcontractor retained by Vendor.

(f) Certificates of Insurance – Prior to the inception of this Agreement, Vendor shall provide to Microsoft certificates of insurance evidencing full compliance with the insurance requirements contained herein. Such certificates shall be kept current throughout the entire period of the Agreement, and Vendor shall provide for at least thirty (30) calendar days advance notice to Microsoft if the coverage is to be canceled or materially altered so as not to comply with the foregoing requirements. Failure by Vendor to furnish certificates of insurance or failure by Microsoft to request same shall not constitute a waiver by Microsoft of the insurance requirements set forth herein. In the event of such failure on the part of Vendor, Microsoft expressly reserves the right to enforce these requirements.

**** = Certain information has been omitted and filed separately with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Confidential treatment has been requested with respect to the omitted portions.

(g) Notice of Loss, Injury or Damage – In the event of any “significant” injury to persons or damage to property that occurs on the premises of Microsoft during the performance of this Agreement by Vendor or any Subcontractor thereof, Vendor shall notify Microsoft as promptly as reasonably practical after the occurrence of such injury or damage, and shall provide adequate details to enable Microsoft to investigate the cause of such injury or damage. For the purposes of this provision, the term “significant” shall mean injury to persons that results in hospital treatment of such injury, and for damage to property, any damage or loss of property in excess of ****.

(h) Workplace Hazards – If Vendor encounters unsafe conditions or workplace hazards in a Microsoft provided and controlled workplace that poses a safety hazard to Vendor’s employees, Vendor shall advise Microsoft promptly in written form of the existence and location of such condition or hazard. If Microsoft is unable to respond and correct the hazard on a timely basis, Vendor shall require its employees to take additional safety and personal protection measures as appropriate to reduce the potential risk of injury to employees working in the area of the condition or hazard until such time as Microsoft is able to correct the hazard.

(i) Revised Code of Washington – To the extent of the indemnity set forth in Section 7 (General Indemnity) of the Agreement, except to the extent prohibited by law, and solely as respect to bodily injury claims by any employees, Subcontractors and/or agents of Vendor which fall within the scope of the foregoing indemnity, Vendor expressly waives its immunity under industrial insurance laws, including but not limited to Title 51 of the Revised Code of the State of Washington, as respects injuries or death suffered by any employees, Subcontractors and/or agents of Vendor.

Article 3: Microsoft Pre-Placement Policy

Microsoft requires all temporary personnel agencies, vendors, suppliers and independent contractors (collectively, “Vendor Employees”) conduct pre-placement background checks on all Vendor employees performing services that require any access to Microsoft resources such as email, network access, cardkey, or other access badges. Before assigning any Vendor employee to perform any such services under this Agreement, Vendor will conduct a pre-placement background check for convictions, covering the last five years (collectively “background check”). If the Vendor employee successfully completed Vendor’s background check within twenty-four months of Vendor employee’s placement with Microsoft, no new background check will be required. Where a Local Agreement specifies that the services will require a Vendor employee to access the credit card or social security information of a Microsoft customer (“Personally Identifiable Information”), before assigning a Vendor employee to perform any such services, Vendor will conduct a pre-placement credit check covering the last three (3) years. If the Vendor employee successfully completed Vendor’s credit check within twelve months of Vendor employee’s placement with Microsoft, no new credit check will be required. Vendor will comply with the Fair Credit Reporting Act and any other applicable on background checks and credit checks. If Vendor chooses to outsource the function of these background and credit checks, Vendor shall, with Microsoft’s consent, use an established and reputable commercial background check company. If Vendor uses any Subcontractors to perform services under this Agreement that require any access to Microsoft resources such as email, network access, cardkey, or other access badges, or that require a Subcontractor to access the credit card or social security information of Microsoft customer, Vendor will ensure its agreements with Subcontractors include the requirements set forth in this policy.

If the background check or credit check discloses information that Vendor, in its sole discretion, concludes would make Vendor’s employee or Subcontractor unacceptable for placement with Microsoft, Vendor will not assign said individual to render any services to Microsoft.

If Microsoft or Vendor becomes aware of criminal activity by Vendor’s employee or Subcontractor while Vendor’s employee or Subcontractor is assigned to work for Microsoft, and Vendor determines this information makes Vendor’s employee or Subcontractor an unacceptable placement, Vendor will take complete responsibility for removing said individual from the Microsoft assignment and from Microsoft property. Vendor shall comply with all applicable laws when removing any Vendor employee or Subcontractor from Microsoft premises. If the criminal activity would suggest a threat of physical harm to Microsoft property or employees, the parties must inform their respective business contact immediately, but in no event later than 24 hours after becoming aware of the information.

Article 4: Vendor Subcontracting Requirements

Subcontractor Requirements

In the event Vendor is unable to comply with the percentage purchase requirements in the Agreement after using best efforts, Vendor shall have the right to include in the calculation of the amount paid by Vendor to Subcontractors those amounts paid by Vendor to Minority Owned and Operated Businesses and to Women Owned and Operated Businesses. By the tenth (10th) business day following November 30 and May 31, Vendor shall report their subcontracted spend for the previous six month period via the Microsoft Supplier Diversity Portal (https://www.suppliergateway.com/microsoft/). Failure by the Vendor to submit their subcontracted spend in compliance to the above referenced dates may, at Microsoft’s sole discretion, result in the reclassification or loss of vendor status and/or participation in MSVP.

If Vendor has used best efforts to fulfill its obligations under this section but has failed to do so for reasons beyond Vendor’s reasonable control, then the Vendor Contact shall, at Microsoft’s request:

 
1. 	Meet with the Microsoft Vendor Account Manager (“VAM”) and Supplier Diversity Program Manager to discuss Vendor’s efforts to comply. If the VAM and Supplier Diversity Program Manager determine that Vendor has made best, but unsuccessful, efforts to be in compliance, then, at Microsoft’s sole reasonable discretion, (a) Microsoft shall not enforce Vendor’s obligations under this section for a period not to exceed the timeframe required by Vendor to comply with the provisions of subsection 2, below, (b) Microsoft shall confirm the same in writing, and (c) Microsoft shall not consider Vendor to be in breach of its obligations under this section, and

 
2. 	Develop, in conjunction with the VAM and Supplier Diversity Program Manager, a mutually agreeable plan (including, but not limited to, a compliance timeline, quarterly compliance milestones, and quarterly reporting requirements) by which Vendor shall come into compliance with its obligations hereunder.

If, after meeting with the Vendor contacts, Microsoft determines in its sole reasonable discretion that it is not feasible or reasonable to require Vendor’s full compliance with this section, Microsoft shall either (a) modify the percentage requirements in order to facilitate Vendor’s compliance or (b) eliminate Vendor’s obligation to comply with this section in its entirety.

The provisions of this section shall not apply if Vendor’s annual receipts are less than **** and the Vendor qualifies as a small business as defined under the Small Business Administration’s Table of Size Standards dated October 1, 2002. However, Vendor must submit an exemption request via the Microsoft Supplier Diversity Portal for each reporting period. If Microsoft does not approve the exemption request, Microsoft shall notify the vendor via e-mail that the Vendor must report their subcontracted spend.
